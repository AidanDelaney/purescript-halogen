## Counter example

This example illustrates using the driver to send queries into a component and update the state from the outside.

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run example-counter
```

Or from the current directory:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run build
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples/counter/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
