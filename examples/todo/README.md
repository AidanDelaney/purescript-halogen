## TODO list

This example illustrates a basic TODO list, taking advantage of parent and child components, and the `peek` function.

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run example-todo
```

Or from the current directory:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run build
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples/todo/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
