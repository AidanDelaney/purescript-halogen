# Module Documentation

## Module Halogen

#### `Render`

``` purescript
type Render s c i = s -> HTML c i
```

A function which renders a component given an array of its rendered children and the current state

#### `FoldState`

``` purescript
type FoldState s i = s -> i -> s
```

A function which can respond to inputs by updating a state

#### `Spec`

``` purescript
newtype Spec s c
```

A `Spec` defines a state machine which responds to inputs of some hidden type `i` and maintains a
state of type `s`. 

The type `c` is used to represent placeholders for child elements.

#### `Void`

``` purescript
data Void
```

An empty type used to indicate the lack of any unpopulated child nodes

#### `Component`

``` purescript
type Component s = Spec s Void
```

A `Component` is a `Spec` with no unpopulated child nodes

#### `mkSpec`

``` purescript
mkSpec :: forall s c i. Render s c i -> FoldState s i -> Spec s c
```

Create a `Spec` by providing a `render` function, and an operation
which updates the state given an input.

The type `i` is hidden in the return type.

#### `embed`

``` purescript
embed :: forall s1 s2 c. LensP s1 s2 -> Spec s2 c -> Spec s1 c
```

`embed` allows us to enlarge the state types by using a `Lens`.

#### `beside`

``` purescript
beside :: forall s1 s2. Spec s1 Void -> Spec s2 Void -> Spec (Tuple s1 s2) Void
```

Side-by-side in a `div` element

#### `append`

``` purescript
append :: forall s c. Spec s (Maybe c) -> Spec s c -> Spec s c
```

Replace the leftmost child placeholder

#### `runComponent`

``` purescript
runComponent :: forall s eff. Component s -> s -> Eff (dom :: DOM, ref :: Ref | eff) Node
```

`runComponent` is responsible for taking a `Component` and hooking up its event
handlers to rerender the DOM. It maintains the state of the component
using a `RefVal`.


## Module Halogen.HTML

#### `MouseEvent`

``` purescript
data MouseEvent
```


#### `Attribute`

``` purescript
data Attribute i
  = OnClick (MouseEvent -> i)
```

#### `functorAttribute`

``` purescript
instance functorAttribute :: Functor Attribute
```


#### `HTML`

``` purescript
data HTML c i
```

The `HTML` type represents HTML documents before being rendered to the virtual DOM, and ultimately,
the actual DOM.

This representation is useful because it supports various typed transformations, such as grafting
child nodes. It also gives a strongly-typed representation for the events which can be
generated by a document.

The type parameters are:

- `c` - the type of child node keys. A sensible top-level document should not have any unpopulated child 
  nodes, so this type should be `Void` in that situation.
- `i` - the type of events which can be generated by this document.

Technically, `HTML` is monadic in its first type argument. However, this `Monad` isn't necessarily very
useful compared to the `Functor` instance on `i`, so it is not provided.

#### `functorHTML`

``` purescript
instance functorHTML :: Functor (HTML c)
```


#### `bifunctorHTML`

``` purescript
instance bifunctorHTML :: Bifunctor HTML
```


#### `renderHtml`

``` purescript
renderHtml :: forall i c eff. (i -> Eff eff Unit) -> HTML c i -> VTree
```

Render a `HTML` document to a virtual DOM node

#### `graft`

``` purescript
graft :: forall i1 i2 c. HTML (Maybe c) i1 -> HTML c i2 -> HTML c (Either i1 i2)
```

Graft a child node, removing a placeholder type

#### `text`

``` purescript
text :: forall i c. String -> HTML c i
```


#### `child`

``` purescript
child :: forall i c. c -> HTML c i
```


#### `button`

``` purescript
button :: forall i c. [Attribute i] -> [HTML c i] -> HTML c i
```

#### `button'`

``` purescript
button' :: forall i c. [HTML c i] -> HTML c i
```


#### `div`

``` purescript
div :: forall i c. [Attribute i] -> [HTML c i] -> HTML c i
```


#### `div'`

``` purescript
div' :: forall i c. [HTML c i] -> HTML c i
```
