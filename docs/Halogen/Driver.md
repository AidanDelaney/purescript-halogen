## Module Halogen.Driver

#### `Driver`

``` purescript
type Driver f eff = Natural f (Aff (HalogenEffects eff))
```

Type alias for driver functions generated by `runUI` - a driver takes an
input of the query algebra (`f`) and returns an `Aff` that returns when
query has been fulfilled.

#### `runUI`

``` purescript
runUI :: forall s f eff. Component s f (Aff (HalogenEffects eff)) -> s -> Aff (HalogenEffects eff) { node :: HTMLElement, driver :: Driver f eff }
```

This function is the main entry point for a Halogen based UI.

The returned value contains the HTML element for the component tree that
then needs attaching to the DOM, and a driver function that can be used to
send actions and requests into the component hierarchy.

The returned driver function allows the "outside world" to communicate
with the UI - a common use case it to use the driver to changes to the
application state in combination with a routing library.
